# Spec: Security baseline

Status: Implemented (2026-06-11); release-window follow-up items 3 and 4 landed
after the 0.1.0 tag.
Priority: P0/P1 split — items 1, 2, and 5 land before the 0.1.0 tag; items 3
and 4 land in the release window, before broad marketing
(`docs/release/grassroots-marketing.md` positions the project as "auditable
tool use", so the gap between claim and posture must close fast).
Depends on: nothing. Items are independently mergeable.

## Purpose

Current posture, as audited June 2026:

- `file_read` (`src/glassrail/harness/builtin.py`) reads **any** path the
  process can read — an LLM-planned `file_read("/etc/passwd")` succeeds.
- `web_fetch` (`src/glassrail/harness/integrations/web.py`) rejects
  non-HTTP(S), private, reserved, and oversized model-chosen targets by
  default.
- `image_generate` (`src/glassrail/harness/integrations/image.py`) writes to
  any user-resolvable `output_path`.
- The REST gateway has optional bearer authentication via `GLASSRAIL_API_KEY`.
  It still has no CORS config.
- The tool `risk` field (`read`/`network`/`write`/`execute`) now participates
  in approval defaults: `write` and `execute` resolve to `ask` unless an
  explicit override wins, while auto mode still treats `ask` as allowed.

The Phase 2 file-editing spec (vault) depends on items 1 and 2 anyway; this
pulls the substrate forward.

## Item 1 — `fs_roots` path confinement (P0) — implemented 2026-06-10

- **Setting:** `fs_roots: list[Path] | None = None` on the tools settings
  model in `src/glassrail/config/settings.py` (the parent model that holds
  `tools.web` / `tools.image` — locate it; expose as `[tools] fs_roots = [...]`,
  env `GLASSRAIL_TOOLS__FS_ROOTS`).
- **Guard:** new module `src/glassrail/harness/pathguard.py`:

  ```python
  def ensure_within_roots(path: str, roots: Sequence[Path] | None) -> Path
  ```

  Behaviour: `expanduser()` then `resolve()` (symlinks resolved). If `roots`
  is `None`/empty: log a **one-time** warning ("file tools are unconfined; set
  tools.fs_roots to restrict them") and return the resolved path — current
  behaviour preserved, so existing flows and the eval fixtures under
  `/tmp/glassrail-eval/` keep working. Otherwise the resolved path must
  satisfy `resolved.is_relative_to(root.expanduser().resolve())` for at least
  one root, else raise `ToolExecutionError("path '<p>' is outside the
  configured tools.fs_roots")`.
- **Wire into:** `file_read` (builtin), `image_generate`'s `output_path`
  resolution, and every future file tool (the Phase 2 file-editing spec
  builds on this helper).
- **Tests:** traversal (`../../etc/passwd` from inside a root → denied),
  symlink escape (symlink inside a tmp root targeting outside → denied
  because resolution happens before the check), allowed path inside a root,
  unconfined-mode warning emitted exactly once.
- **Docs:** README Tools section gains the `fs_roots` row and a sentence on
  the default; note that a future minor release will flip the default to
  confined.

## Item 2 — Honor `risk` in tool approval (P0) — implemented 2026-06-10

**File:** `Executor._approve_tool_call` in `src/glassrail/executor/executor.py`.

Effective-policy resolution becomes:

1. An explicit per-tool override in `settings.tool_approval.overrides` wins.
2. Otherwise, if `harness.risk_for(tool)` is `"write"` or `"execute"` →
   effective policy is `ASK`.
3. Otherwise → `settings.tool_approval.default`.

Everything downstream is unchanged: `mode = "auto"` still treats `ASK` as
allow (headless runs keep working — this is deliberate; auto mode is the
operator saying "I accept unattended execution"), explicit `DENY` always
denies, interactive mode with a broker prompts, interactive mode without a
broker logs and denies.

- **Tests:** write-risk tool, no override, interactive mode with broker →
  approval requested; same in auto mode → runs; explicit `allow` override on a
  write-risk tool → runs without asking; read-risk tool unaffected.
- **Docs:** README Tool Approval section documents the risk-derived default;
  fix the `ToolRisk` docstring in `src/glassrail/core/plan.py` so the
  claim matches reality (it now does).

## Item 3 — `web_fetch` hardening (release window) — implemented 2026-06-11

**File:** `src/glassrail/harness/integrations/web.py`.

- **Scheme allowlist:** only `http`/`https`; anything else →
  `ToolExecutionError`.
- **Private-address rejection:** resolve the hostname
  (`socket.getaddrinfo`, run via `asyncio.to_thread`); if **any** resolved
  address has `ipaddress.ip_address(addr)` with `is_private`, `is_loopback`,
  `is_link_local`, `is_reserved`, `is_multicast`, or `is_unspecified` →
  reject, unless the new setting `tools.web.allow_private_hosts: bool = False`
  is true (needed for self-hosted SearXNG users fetching internal pages —
  note: `web_search`'s configured `searxng_url` is operator-supplied config,
  not model-controlled input, so it is exempt from this check).
  Document the residual DNS-rebinding race (resolve-then-connect) as a known
  v1 limitation in the module docstring.
- **Size cap:** `tools.web.max_fetch_bytes: int = 5_000_000`; switch the GET
  to `client.stream(...)` and accumulate `aiter_bytes()` chunks, aborting with
  `ToolExecutionError` when the cap is exceeded (do not trust
  `Content-Length`).
- **Redirects:** set `max_redirects=5` explicitly.
- **Tests** (extend `tests/unit/test_web_tools.py`, `httpx.MockTransport`):
  `ftp://` rejected; `http://127.0.0.1/x` and `http://169.254.169.254/meta`
  rejected; allowed when `allow_private_hosts=true`; body larger than a small
  test cap rejected mid-stream.
- **Docs:** README web-tools block gains the two new keys.

## Item 4 — REST bearer auth (release window) — implemented 2026-06-11

- **Setting:** `api_key: str | None = None` on `Settings`
  (`GLASSRAIL_API_KEY`). `None` (default) = no auth, current behaviour.
- **HTTP:** when set, an `@app.middleware("http")` in
  `src/glassrail/gateways/rest/app.py` requires
  `Authorization: Bearer <key>` (compare with `secrets.compare_digest`) on
  every route **except `/health`**; failure → 401 JSON body.
- **WebSocket:** middleware does not cover WS — check the header (or an
  `api_key` query parameter as a browser-client fallback) in the WS endpoint
  *before* `accept()`; reject with close code 1008.
- **Tests** (extend `tests/integration/test_rest_gateway.py` /
  `test_rest_ws_events.py`): with `api_key` set — 401 without header, 200 with
  correct bearer, `/health` open, WS closes 1008 without key; with `api_key`
  unset — everything open (regression).
- **Docs:** README Security notes + `docs/deployment.md` env example gain
  `GLASSRAIL_API_KEY`.

## Item 5 — Keep the README security notes truthful (P0, ongoing)

The README's "Security notes" section must move with the implementation so it
never overstates or understates the posture. With items 1–4 landed, it now
points operators at `tools.fs_roots`, `GLASSRAIL_API_KEY`, web-fetch guardrails,
and approval policies.

## Non-goals

- Sandboxing/subprocess isolation of tools (Phase 4).
- CORS policy (no browser client exists yet; add alongside any web UI).
- Multi-user authz/rate limiting.
- Outbound egress proxying.

## Acceptance criteria

- Full check sweep green per item.
- Item 1: the three pathguard tests; eval suites still green (default
  unconfined).
- Item 2: harness-mechanics tool tasks still green (their tools are read/
  network risk); the four approval tests.
- Item 3: SSRF/size tests green; a normal `web_fetch` against MockTransport
  unchanged.
- Item 4: auth test matrix green; `curl` without a key gets 401 when
  `GLASSRAIL_API_KEY` is set.
- README/deployment docs updated in the same PRs; CHANGELOG entries per item.
